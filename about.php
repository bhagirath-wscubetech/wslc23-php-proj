		<p> Minor Projects are really not hard to develop, as also the colleges generally are not strict in accepting
			the minor projects.Minor Projects can be small but it must be remarkable. Because details of Minor Projects
			are required to put in your Resume. And students with good minor projects can be easily placed in good
			companies during Campus Placements. </p>
